# data-cleaning-and-EDA

Overview :
This project involves performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Wine Dataset obtained from Kaggle. The primary objective is to explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

Dataset :
The dataset used in this project is the Wine Dataset from Kaggle, which includes various attributes of wine such as alcohol content, acidity, pH level, and quality ratings. This dataset provides a comprehensive view of the factors that influence wine quality and allows for an in-depth analysis of the relationships between these variables.

Objectives :
Data Cleaning- Handle missing values, outliers, and perform necessary transformations to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)- Summarize the main characteristics of the data.
Visualize the distribution of individual variables.
Explore the relationships between variables using correlation analysis, scatter plots, and other visualization techniques.
Pattern and Trend Identification- Identify significant patterns and trends in the data that can provide insights into the factors affecting wine quality.

Results :
The results of the analysis, including visualizations and insights, are documented in the respective Jupyter notebooks and can be viewed by running the notebooks in a Jupyter environment.
